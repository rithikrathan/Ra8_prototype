# Working on the fetch unit:

work with the input and output signals like delay and insert zero input form the decode unit and the incremment programcounter signal going out from this fetch unit so work on that also i just wasted a lot of time trying to fix a stupid problem whose solution is just a simple D flip flop to delay the select signal for 1 cycle.
